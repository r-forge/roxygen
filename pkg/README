all' hileth', Hephaiste; didou d'areten te kai olbon.*
--Homer, 7th century BCE


1. Roxygen

1.1. Execution

The driver in the `sandbox' directory, `roxygenize.R', creates a package
skeleton `pkg.roxygen'; populates its `man' directory with Rd files from
the source; generates a NAMESPACE; and modifies the Collate field in
`DESCRIPTION'.

Run it from the root of the repository (i.e. one above the package
root):

    R --slave --vanilla < pkg/sandbox/roxygenize.R

If all goes well, you should be able to run `R CMD check' on the
newly created directory; and find `roxygen-manual.pdf' in
`pkg.roxygen.Rcheck':

    R CMD check pkg.roxygen && \
    xpdf pkg.roxygen.Rcheck/roxygen-manual.pdf

1.2. TODO

* Create a driver (possibly used by `R CMD roxygen') which farms out
  the results of each roclet to appropriate files in a package
  skeleton.

* Create some automatic method for detecting S3 methods without
  resorting to @method <generic> <class>.

* Edit the R emacs mode to identify roxygen delimiters when filling,
  etc.

* Find a reasonable way to document the inner functions of make.roclet,
  etc.

1.3. BUGS

* parse.formals doesn't distinguish between no default argument and
  NULL; need a special value?

* Skeletal Rds are created for assignments without Roxygen-blocks;
  desirable?

* first.sentence is fooled by infix periods, whereupon it resorts to
  `...'.

-----------
* Hail, Hephaistos! Grant skill and weal.
