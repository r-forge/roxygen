all' hileth', Hephaiste; didou d'areten te kai olbon.*

1.1. Execution

The driver in the `sandbox' directory, `main.R', parses an arbitrary
source file; but defaults to `example.R' from the original GSoC
proposal.

Upon execution, one should see a parse-tree of parsed elements
(represented as lists); accompanied by a srcref of the apposite
object:

    $ cd sandbox
    $ R --vanilla --slave --args example.R < main.R

    List of 3
     $ 1:List of 6
      ..$ description: chr "This class represents a person."
      ..$ slot       :List of 2
      .. ..$ name       : chr "fullname"
      .. ..$ description: chr "The full name of the person"

    ...

1.2. TODO

Mode of interaction with the Roclets has yet to be determined; simple
API via library() would suffice; though a parse-tree <-> S-expression
translator would also work.

The advantage of the latter, I suppose, is that extra-R tools could
process the parse tree.
