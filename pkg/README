all' hileth', Hephaiste; didou d'areten te kai olbon.*
--Homer, 7th century BCE


1. Roxygen

1.1. Execution

The driver in the `sandbox' directory, `main.R', parses an arbitrary
source file; but defaults to `example.R' from the original GSoC
proposal.

Upon execution, one should see a parse-tree of parsed elements
(represented as lists); accompanied by a srcref of the apposite
object:

    $ cd sandbox
    $ R --vanilla --slave --args example.R < main.R

    List of 3
     $ 1:List of 6
      ..$ description: chr "This class represents a person."
      ..$ slot       :List of 2
      .. ..$ name       : chr "fullname"
      .. ..$ description: chr "The full name of the person"

    ...

To test the Rd, namespace and collate roclets: there are similarly
`Rd.R', `namespace.R' and `collate.R' in the same directory.

1.2. TODO

* Create a driver (possibly used by `R CMD roxygen') which farms out
  the results of each roclet to appropriate files in a package
  skeleton.

1.3. BUGS

* parse.formals doesn't distinguish between no default argument and
  NULL; need a special value?

* Skeletal Rds are created for assignments without Roxygen-blocks;
  desirable?

* first.sentence is fooled by infix periods, whereupon it resorts to
  \dots.

-----------
* Hail, Hephaistos! Grant skill and weal.
