1. Roxygen

1.1. Execution

The driver in the `sandbox' directory, `roxygenize.R', creates a
package skeleton `pkg.roxygen'; populates its `man' directory with Rd
files from the source; generates a `NAMESPACE'; modifies the Collate
field in `DESCRIPTION'; and creates call graphs in `inst/doc'.

Run it from the root of the repository (i.e. one above the package
root):

    R --slave --vanilla < pkg/sandbox/roxygenize.R

If all goes well, you should be able to run `R CMD check' on the
newly created directory; and find `roxygen-manual.pdf' in
`pkg.roxygen.Rcheck':

    R CMD check pkg.roxygen && \
    xpdf pkg.roxygen.Rcheck/roxygen-manual.pdf

1.2. TODO

* Convert the `sandbox/roxygenize.R' driver into an `R CMD roxygen'.

  * Makefile.win which uses sed to chop off the first line; else:
    simple script to `#! /bin/sh'. See Sweave.

* Create some automatic method for detecting S3 methods without
  resorting to @method <generic> <class>.

* Edit the R emacs mode to identify roxygen delimiters when filling,
  etc.

* Find a reasonable way to document the inner functions of make.roclet,
  etc.

* Move demos from `sandbox' to `demos'.

1.3. BUGS

* parse.formals doesn't distinguish between no default argument and
  NULL; need a special value?

* Skeletal Rds are created for assignments without Roxygen-blocks;
  desirable?

* first.sentence is fooled by infix periods, whereupon it resorts to
  `...'.

* de.tex doesn't work recursively (i.e. de-TeXs only the top level).

* `<<' in titles produces a spurious box.

* Nameless Rd entries are written to standard out with no warning.

* @deprecated?

-----------
* Hail, Hephaistos! Grant skill and weal.
