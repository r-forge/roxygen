all' hileth', Hephaiste; didou d'areten te kai olbon.*
--Homer, 7th century BCE

1.1. Execution

The driver, `main.R', parses an arbitrary source file; but defaults to
`example.R' from the original GSoC proposal.

Upon execution, one should see a parse-tree of parsed elements
(represented as lists); accompanied by a srcref of the apposite
object:

    $ R --vanilla --slave --args example.R < main.R

    $`1`
    $`1`$description
    [1] "This class represents a person."

    ...

1.2. TODO

Mode of interaction with the Roclets has yet to be determined; simple
API via library() would suffice; though a parse-tree <-> S-expression
translator would also work.

The advantage of the latter, I suppose, is that extra-R tools could
process the parse tree.

* Hail, Hephaistos! Grant skill and weal.
