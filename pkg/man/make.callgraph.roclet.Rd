\description{Make a callgraph roclet which produces a static call graph
from a given function at a given depth with or without
primitives.}
\details{The callgraph roclet supports the following tags:

\enumerate{
\item{\code{@callGraph}}{Create a call graph of the default
depth, excluding primitive functions.}
\item{\code{@callGraphPrimitives}}{Create a call graph of the
default depth, including primitive functions.}
\item{\code{@callGraphDepth}}{Change the depth of the callgraph
from the default of 2.}
}

The callgraph roclet is awkward in the sense that
it requires a function's package to be loadable;
which means, like calling LaTeX multiple times,
one has to run roxygen on a package, install it,
run roxygen again to get the callgraphs, and possibly
install the package again.}
